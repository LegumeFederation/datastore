## allelic_pangene_method
Method for calculating a pan-gene set from a collection of annotations in a species (or related species)

Note that this repository doesn't contain the raw or intermediate data. The raw/initial files come
from the Data Store (https://legumeinfo.org/data/public/Glycine_max/ and https://legumeinfo.org/data/public/Glycine_soja/).
The output of the method (using the example of six soybean genomes) is in the three 'soy_pangene...' files. 

The main files of interest are the "methods" notes : [notes/allelic_pangene_methods.sh] (notes/allelic_pangene_methods.sh)
and the scripts (which are extremely simple, except for the clustering script by Michelle McMahon and
Mike Sanderson [modified by S. Cannon]).
