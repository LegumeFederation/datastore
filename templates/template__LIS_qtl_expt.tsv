Synopsis	Study of Pod Dehiscence QTLs, in PD-susceptible x resistant RIL population of 238 individuals.
Description	Pod Dehiscence QTLs were identified using three phenotyping methods and an ICA Bunsi (PD-susceptible) x SXB 405 (PD-resistant) recombinant inbred mapping population.  An unreplicated spring planting of 238 RIL field plots were visually evaluated for dehiscence.  A replicated summer planting produced mature, non-dehiscing pods from 191 RILs that were phenotyped in two ways: the proportion of pods dehiscing after 7 days in a 65 C dessicator and 7 subsequent days at room temperature, and peak force required to induce pod fracture at the apical end of the pod beak measured with an Imada force measurement guage.  Composite interval mapping was completed with the R package R/qtl.
TaxonID	3885
MappingParent	phavu.ICA Bunsi
MappingParent	phavu.SXB 405
MappingDescription	The ICABunsi_x_SXB405_a map was developed using an 238-RIL population derived from the domesticated Middle American ICA Bunsi (PD-susceptible) and SXB 405 (PD-resistant).  The map is composed of 382 SNP markers.
GenotypingPlatform	BARCBean6K_3
GenotypingMethod	Illumina Infinium II BARCBean6K_3 BeadChip. Genomic DNA was extracted from parents and RILs using a modified CTAB method and DNA quality assessed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.
