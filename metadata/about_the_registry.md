The Legume Federation registry is a simple table, showing correspondences between unique keys and the corresponding directory paths that contain data collections.

The Data Store protocols are documented here:
  https://github.com/LegumeFederation/datastore/blob/master/metadata/about_the_data_repository.md

The registry can be accessed here: 
  http://bit.ly/LegFed_registry

If you want edit access (if you are managing data files in a federation filesystem), 
please request access via the Google document menu.

Files and directories in the data directory are made browsable using the h5ai web server index.
See more about this package here: https://larsjung.de/h5ai/.
